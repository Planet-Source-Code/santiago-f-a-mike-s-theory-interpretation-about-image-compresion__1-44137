## A Mike's theory interpretation about Image Compresion


</div>

### Description

This source code is the interpretation about the Mike's theory about image compresion.

This is an algorythm to find the similar pieces of image and try to make it one.

I think that it is useful for who wants to make an image scanner or similar work and too for who want to make FX with image due the tratament of image in this code.

I use CopyMemory, FillMemory and GetDIs to make the process faster than a common VB functions.

I think you can learn about this API that are very useful when you wanna make a better and faster algorythm.

I don't make the module of GetDIs, this module was written by Marco Samy - marco_s2@hotmail.com.

You can download his source code at:

If you think that this code is useful and you wanna make it better, feel free.

And please, post comments about it to say what do you think.

The Mike theory is in the zip file but you can download at:
